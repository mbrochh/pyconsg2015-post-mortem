            ## The Bad

            * Not enough attendees (we need 100 more!)
            * Not enough women
            * Venue is very hot for sponsors and helpers
            * Little interaction between sponsors and attendees
              * People are too shy!
            * Knowledge gap, people seemed bored
            * No social after-event
